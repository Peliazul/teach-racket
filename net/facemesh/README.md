# Introduction

This is a slightly extended version of the facemesh site shown
in the movie "The social network". So, in a way, this is the
origin of Facebook.

To use it, you have to fill the "pics" directory with pictures of
girls and boys, where girls should start with "g" and boys with "b".
Please use image sizes appopriate for websites. 


* Caveat

Please note that this program is either stritly for fun, or
to be combined with some serious discussions on cyber-mobbing, 
dissing, the value of beauty/social status etc. 

Using real fotos of students is of course the most fun, 
but can lead to some nasty comments.

Strictly coupling boys with girls is also just an algorithmic choice,
no political statement.
