# Introduction

This is a very simple implementation of the Hangman game.
However, the function which returns a "starred" word 
(with only the letters algready guessed diplayed, all other
letters replaced by stars) and also the test whether a
word is completely solved/guessed take some
time to understand.

Since word is a simple string and the guesses a simple list
of characters, it's instructive to try the functions on
the interactive prompt. To understand the functions
it's also recommended to try some usage examples of
"string->list", "list->string", "member" and "filter".
