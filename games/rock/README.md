# Introduction

This is the simple game "Rock, Paper, Scissor (Match, Well)",
but it can be easily adapted to ...Lizard, Spock.

Its difficulty is medium, since it keeps track of all the scores etc.

This is a true multiplayer game, except we don't have a login, and
every user must enter her name each time she plays. After startung up
the program, and making the URL public in the class, each player can
enter a choice. Click "Reload" to check whether everyone has made a
choice, and "Play" to evaluate.

Most page elements have an Id, so you can go on to add some bling
in htdocs/rock.css


As you may notice from reading the code, the game contains a 
cheat-code.
