#  Introduction

This is a very common programming example, at least in Lisp, where it
is simple to implement (see SICP).

It's a rather simple implementation which uses a hash of functions for
the rules. The same technique can be used to transform a
Scheme-Formula to something the formula editor of LibeOffice can
understand.

The question how to simplify the result is, of course, much harder.
