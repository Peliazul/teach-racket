# Introduction

Two nice and simple fractals. The graphics format written is PNM,
which is not that space efficiant or even widely supported, 
but it can be opened with The Gimp.

I guess a while-Loop in Pascal is much easier to understand than
using recursion and functions as parameters, but hey, it's Scheme!
